## Bugs and issues
Bug reports help make Infisical a better experience for everyone. When you report a bug, a template will be created automatically containing information weâ€™d like to know.

Before raising a new issue, please search existing ones to make sure youâ€™re not creating a duplicate.

## Deciding what to work on

You can start by browsing through our list of issues or adding your own that improves on the platform experience. Once youâ€™ve decided on an issue, leave a comment and wait to get approved; this helps avoid multiple people working on the same issue.

If youâ€™re ever in doubt about whether or not a proposed feature aligns with Infisical as a whole, feel free to raise an issue about it and weâ€™ll get back to you promptly.
